An attempt to follow the Roguelike Tutorial using Dart and the malison package.


Sources and inspiration, from which I have borrowed heavily:

The Python tutorial that I am basing this project on. A great place to start if you want to get into roguelike development!

"Bob Nystrom - Is There More to Game Architecture than ECS?"
Fantastic talk about game programming patterns.

Awesome roguelike, mentioned in the talk above.

Two Dart packages that are immensely useful for roguelike development!
