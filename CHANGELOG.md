## 1.0.5

- Substantial re-write. Code re-organised along the lines of Hauberk,
now easier to manage. Code now even more a hybrid of Hauberk, the
Python libtcod tutorial, and my own ideas.
- Part 6 of the tutorial implemented. The hero can deal and take damage,
and die.

## 1.0.0

- Initial version, created by Stagehand
